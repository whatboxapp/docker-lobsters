## About

This repo contains a working example of how to use and deploy [Lobsters][lobsters] within a Docker environment.  
I have decided to create this project to assist anyone else wanting to get started with Lobsters quickly using Docker.

This image is built off of the official Ruby Docker image ([ruby:2.3-alpine][ruby-alpine])

## Quick Start

Using this repository.  
This will serve up Lobsters at http://localhost/

```shell
git clone git@github.com:utensils/docker-lobsters.git
cd docker-lobsters
git submodule update --init --recursive
make
docker network create webproxy
#chang domain
docker-compose up
```

Using the prebuilt docker hub build and official [MariaDB image][mariadb image].  
This will serve up Lobsters at http://localhost:3000/

```shell
docker run --name lobsters -v lobsters_data:/var/lib/mysql -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password -e MYSQL_DATABASE=lobsters -d mariadb
docker run -p 3000:3000 --link lobsters:mariadb utensils/lobsters
```
